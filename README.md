## Introduction

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

How to Play: Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

There will be a popup showing the game results after matching all the cards.
